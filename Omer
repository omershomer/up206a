######My name is Omer Sohail and I grew up in Southern California, specifically Orange and Riverside counties. I am interested in this course because I want to acquire a basic understanding of coding with python and learn more about spatial data science. My background is in the political sector and I have deep understanding of Inland Southern California's political landscape. Though I am still learning about LA/coastal areas, I feel like much of it is very much connected to the IE as well. 
######I love biking both recreationally and for commuting. I want to work towards a world where all people can feel safe and comfortable biking. I constantly think about what improvements are necessary to achieve that as I go about my daily routine. Though I haven't had much of a chance lately to ride on the street (since we are all virtual for the time being) I'm excited to get back on that transit/biking grind.
